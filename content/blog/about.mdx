I like solving challenging problems that live on the intersection of technology and humans.

I am currently focused on decentralized identity solutions related to Decentralized Web Nodes. Co-Chair of Decentralized Web Node WG at Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), Co-Lead of the Trust Registry Task Force @ Trust Over IP, and Chair of the Technical Steering Committee at DIF.

My style around engineering is to balance exploration with pragmatism. I love mature R&D, with an edge toward production grade results. Full stack, with a bend toward backend/ML, and a capability of cobbling together UI's on vue.js or other frameworks if needed. I classify myself as an autodidact, and I've learned most the skills I have today from real projects.

If you're interested in learning more or just chatting, feel free to reach out to me.
